# Detection of Ice Deposits in Lunar HiRISE Images

This project focuses on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and Python to detect ice deposits in lunar HiRISE images. Collected between November and December 2023, the lunar data was processed with sophisticated image augmentation techniques to enhance training robustness. By leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16 architectures, we optimized the final layers for accurate lunar image classification. The modelâ€™s performance was rigorously evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, confirming its effectiveness in identifying diverse lunar terrain features.
